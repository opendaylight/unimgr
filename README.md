unimgr
------

The unimgr project is an OpenDaylight component that implements the MEF Legato and Presto API
reference points to provide management of connectivity services across multi-vendor
devices. Currently supported devices are:

* Cisco IOS-XR devices managed via Netconf
* Cisco IOS-XE devices managed via CLI
* Openflow switches managed via OVSDB

Building unimgr
----

To build and test the unimgr project:

```
% mvn clean install
```

If you want to skip the tests then:

```
% mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Running unimgr
----

The unimgr project builds a karaf distribution that has the umimgr component as a deployed
feature. It is necessary to set a higher than default maximum heap size for the JVM when running
karaf:

```
% export JAVA_MAX_MEM=2g
% ./karaf/target/assembly/bin/karaf

Apache Karaf starting up. Press Enter to open the shell now...

If you want to run karaf in debug mode so that you can attach a debugger:

```
% ./karaf/target/assembly/bin/karaf debug
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
Apache Karaf starting up. Press Enter to open the shell now...
```

You can then attach a debugger to localhost:5005

OpenDaylight Console
----

You can use the karaf console to verify that the unimgr is running:

```
opendaylight-user@root>bundle:list | grep unimgr | grep -v wrap
340 | Active   |  80 | 0.4.0.SNAPSHOT                      | ODL :: unimgr :: unimgr-api
341 | Active   |  80 | 0.4.0.SNAPSHOT                      | ODL :: unimgr :: unimgr-cli
342 | Active   |  80 | 0.4.0.SNAPSHOT                      | ODL :: unimgr :: unimgr-impl
343 | Active   |  80 | 0.4.0.SNAPSHOT                      | unimgr-nrp-tapi-api
344 | Active   |  80 | 0.4.0.SNAPSHOT                      | ODL :: unimgr :: unimgr-presto-api
```

You can use the karaf console to monitor the OpenDaylight log messages:

```
